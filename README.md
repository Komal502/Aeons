# React Quiz App (Frontend Only)

A clean, modern quiz platform built with **React + Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**. Includes simple login/signup using `localStorage`, a dashboard, quiz flow, and results.

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Run dev server
npm run dev

# 3) Build for production
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Tech
- React 18 + Vite
- React Router v6
- TailwindCSS 3 (already configured)

## Notes
- Authentication is mock (stored in localStorage). For real auth, integrate Firebase Auth or your backend.
- Edit questions in `src/data.js`.
